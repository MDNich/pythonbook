<p>While a program is running, its data is stored in <em>random access memory</em> (RAM).
RAM is fast and inexpensive, but it is also <strong>volatile</strong>, which means that when
the program ends, or the computer shuts down, data in RAM disappears. To make
data available the next time the computer is turned on and the program
is started, it has to be written to a <strong>non-volatile</strong> storage medium,
such a hard drive, usb drive, or DVD.</p>
<p>Data on non-volatile storage media is stored in named locations on the media
called <strong>files</strong>. By reading and writing files, programs can save information
between program runs.</p>
<p>Working with files is a lot like working with a notebook. To use a notebook,
it has to be opened. When done, it has to be closed.  While the
notebook is open, it can either be read from or written to. In either case,
the notebook holder knows where they are. They can read the whole notebook in its
natural order or they can skip around.</p>
<p>All of this applies to files as well. To open a file, we specify its name and
indicate whether we want to read or write.</p>

<h2>9.2. Writing our first file<a class="headerlink" href="#writing-our-first-file" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Let&#8217;s begin with a simple program that writes three lines of text into a file:</p>

<div id="filefirstexample" class="pywindow" >

<div id="filefirstexample_code_div" style="display: block">
<textarea rows="5" id="filefirstexample_code" class="active_code" prefixcode="undefined">
myfile = open("test.txt", "w")
myfile.write("My first file written from Python\n")
myfile.write("---------------------------------\n")
myfile.write("Hello, world!\n")
myfile.close()</textarea>
</div>
<script type="text/javascript">
pythonTool.lineNumberFlags['filefirstexample_code'] = true;
pythonTool.readOnlyFlags['filefirstexample_code'] = true;
</script>

<div id='filefirstexample_error'></div>
<pre id="filefirstexample_suffix" style="display:none">
</pre>
</div>

<p>Opening a file creates what we call a file <strong>handle</strong>. In this example, the variable <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">myfile</span></tt>
refers to the new handle object.  Our program calls methods on the handle, and this makes
changes to the actual file which is usually located on our disk.</p>
<p>On line 1, the open function takes two arguments. The first is the name of the file, and
the second is the <strong>mode</strong>. Mode <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;w&quot;</span></tt> means that we are opening the file for
writing.</p>
<p>With mode <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;w&quot;</span></tt>, if there is no file named <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">test.txt</span></tt> on the disk,
it will be created. If there already is one, it will be replaced by the
file we are writing.</p>
<p>To put data in the file we invoke the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">write</span></tt> method on the handle, shown
in lines 2, 3 and 4 above.  In bigger programs, lines 2&#8211;4 will usually be
replaced by a loop that writes many more lines into the file.</p>
<p>Closing the file handle (line 5) tells the system that we are done writing and makes
the disk file available for reading by other programs (or by our own program).</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="admonition-a-handle-is-somewhat-like-a-tv-remote-control admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">A handle is somewhat like a TV remote control</p>
<p>We&#8217;re all familiar with a remote control for a TV.  We perform operations on
the remote control &#8212; switch channels, change the volume, etc.  But the real action
happens on the TV.  So, by simple analogy, we&#8217;d call the remote control our <cite>handle</cite>
to the underlying TV.</p>
<p class="last">Sometimes we want to emphasize the difference &#8212; the file handle is not the same
as the file, and the remote control is not the same as the TV.
But at other times we prefer to treat them as a single mental chunk, or abstraction,
and we&#8217;ll just say &#8220;close the file&#8221;, or &#8220;flip the TV channel&#8221;.</p>

<h2>9.3. Reading a file line-at-a-time<a class="headerlink" href="#reading-a-file-line-at-a-time" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Now that the file exists on our disk, we can open it, this time for reading, and read all
the lines in the file, one at a time. This time, the mode argument is <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;r&quot;</span></tt> for reading:</p>

<div id="readfirstexample" class="pywindow" >

<div id="readfirstexample_code_div" style="display: block">
<textarea rows="10" id="readfirstexample_code" class="active_code" prefixcode="undefined">
mynewhandle = open("test.txt", "r")
while True:                            # Keep reading forever
    theline = mynewhandle.readline()   # Try to read next line
    if len(theline) == 0:              # If there are no more lines
        break                          #     leave the loop

    # Now process the line we've just read
    print(theline, end="")

mynewhandle.close()</textarea>

pythonTool.lineNumberFlags['readfirstexample_code'] = true;

</script>

<div id='readfirstexample_error'></div>
<pre id="readfirstexample_suffix" style="display:none">
</pre>
</div>

<p>This is a handy pattern for our toolbox. In bigger programs, we&#8217;d
squeeze more extensive logic into the body of the loop at line 8 &#8212;
for example, if each line of the file contained the name and email address
of one of our friends, perhaps we&#8217;d split the line into some pieces and
call a function to send the friend a party invitation.</p>
<p>On line 8 we suppress the newline character that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">print</span></tt>
usually appends to our strings.  Why?  This is because the string already
has its own newline:  the <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">readline</span></tt> method in line 3 returns everything
up to <em>and including</em> the newline character.  This also explains the
end-of-file detection logic: when there are no more lines to be
read from the file, <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">readline</span></tt> returns an empty string &#8212; one that does not
even have a newline at the end, hence its length is 0.</p>
<blockquote>
<div><div class="admonition-fail-first admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Fail first ...</p>
<p>In our sample case here, we have three lines in the file, yet
we enter the loop <em>four</em> times.  In Python, you only learn that
the file has no more lines by failure to read another line.
In some other programming languages
(e.g. Pascal), things are different: there you read three lines,
but you have what is called <em>look ahead</em> &#8212; after reading the third
line you already know that there are no more lines in the file.
You&#8217;re not even allowed to try to read the fourth line.</p>
<p>So the templates for working line-at-a-time in Pascal and Python are
subtly different!</p>
<p class="last">When you transfer your Python skills to your next computer language,
be sure to ask how you&#8217;ll know when the file has ended: is the style
in the language &#8220;try, and after you fail you&#8217;ll know&#8221;, or is
it &#8220;look ahead&#8221;?</p>
</div>
</div></blockquote>
<p>You can also use a <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">for</span></tt> loop to read from a file. Each time we execute the loop, the
loop variable (<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">theline</span></tt> in the example below) will be the next line of the file. The
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">for</span></tt> loop will automatically end after the final line of the file is read.</p>

<h2>9.4. Turning a file into a list of lines<a class="headerlink" href="#turning-a-file-into-a-list-of-lines" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>It is often useful to fetch data from
a disk file and turn it into a list of lines.  Suppose we have a
file containing our friends and their email addresses, one per line
in the file.  But we&#8217;d like the lines sorted into
alphabetical order.  A good plan is to read everything into a
list of lines, then sort the list, and then write the sorted list
back to another file:</p>

<div id="sortfileexample" class="pywindow" >

<div id="sortfileexample_code_div" style="display: block">
<textarea rows="11" id="sortfileexample_code" class="active_code" prefixcode="undefined">
f = open("friends.txt", "r")
xs = f.readlines()   # reads the whole file at once into a list
f.close()

xs.sort()   # sorts the list

# now write the sorted list to a new file
g = open("sortedfriends.txt", "w")
for v in xs:
    g.write(v)
g.close()</textarea>
</div>
<script type="text/javascript">

pythonTool.readOnlyFlags['sortfileexample_code'] = true;

<div id='sortfileexample_error'></div>
<pre id="sortfileexample_suffix" style="display:none">
</pre>
</div>

<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">readlines</span></tt> method in line 2 reads all the lines and
returns a list of the strings.</p>
<p>We could have used the template from the previous section to read each line
one-at-a-time, and to build up the list ourselves, but it is a lot easier
to use the method that the Python implementors gave us!</p>
<div class="admonition-your-file-paths-may-need-to-be-explicitly-named admonition">
<p class="first admonition-title">Your file paths may need to be explicitly named.</p>
<p class="last">In the above examples, we&#8217;re assuming that the file we&#8217;re reading from is
in the same directory as your Python source code.  If this is
not the case, you may need to provide a full or a relative path to the file.  On Windows, a full
path could look like <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;C:\\temp\\somefile.txt&quot;</span></tt>, while on a Unix system the full path could be
<tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">&quot;/home/jimmy/somefile.txt&quot;</span></tt>.</p>

<span id="index-1"></span><h2>9.5. An example<a class="headerlink" href="#an-example" title="Permalink to this headline">¶</a></h2>
<p>Many useful line-processing programs will read a text file line-at-a-time and do some minor
processing as they write the lines to an output file.  They might number the
lines in the output file, or insert extra blank lines after every 60 lines to
make it convenient for printing on sheets of paper, or extract some specific
columns only from each line in the source file, or only print lines that
contain a specific substring.  We call this kind of program a <strong>filter</strong>.</p>
<p>Here is a filter that copies one file to another,
omitting any lines that begin with <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">#</span></tt>:</p>

<div id="filefilterexample" class="pywindow" >

<div id="filefilterexample_code_div" style="display: block">
<textarea rows="12" id="filefilterexample_code" class="active_code" prefixcode="undefined">
def filter(oldfile, newfile):
    # open the files
    infile = open(oldfile, "r")
    outfile = open(newfile, "w")
    # process the files
    for text in infile:
        if text[0] == "#":
            continue   # skip any lines that start with "#"
        outfile.write(text)   # write any other lines to outfile
    # close the files
    infile.close()
    outfile.close()</textarea>

<pre id="filefilterexample_suffix" style="display:none">
</pre>
</div>

<p>The <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">continue</span></tt> statement at line 8 skips over the remaining lines in
the current iteration of the loop, but the loop will still iterate.</p>
<p>Let&#8217;s consider one more case: suppose our original file contained empty
lines.  At line 6 above, would this program find the first empty line in the
file, and terminate immediately?   No!  Recall that <tt class="docutils literal"><span class="pre">readline</span></tt> always
includes the newline character in the string it returns.  It is only when we
try to read <em>beyond</em> the end of the file that we get back the empty string of length 0.</p>
