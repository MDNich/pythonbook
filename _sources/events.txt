Event-Driven Programming
========================

Most programs and devices like a cellphone respond to *events* --- things that happen.
For example, you might move your mouse, and the computer responds.  Or you click a button,
and the program does something interesting.   In this chapter we'll touch very briefly on
how event-driven programming works.

   .. admonition:: Events don't play nice with our ebook

      In most other chapters of our ebook, you can run Python code directly in the book.
      However, in this chapter, you can't, because event-driven programs don't really work all that well
      in the ebook. So you'll need to cut-and-paste the code samples over to IDLE in order
      to run the examples in this chapter.


Keypress events
---------------

Here's a program with some new features.  Copy it into your workspace, run it.  When the 
turtle window opens, press the arrow keys and make tess move about! 


.. activecode:: turtlekp
   :norun:

   import turtle

   turtle.setup(400,500)                # Determine the window size
   wn = turtle.Screen()                 # Get a reference to the window
   wn.title("Handling keypresses!")     # Change the window title
   wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")             # Set the background color
   tess = turtle.Turtle()               # Create our favorite turtle

   # The next four functions are our "event handlers".
   def h1():
       tess.forward(30)

   def h2():
       tess.left(45)

   def h3():
       tess.right(45)

   def h4():
       wn.bye()                        # Close down the turtle window

   # These lines "wire up" keypresses to the handlers we've defined.
   wn.onkey(h1, "Up")
   wn.onkey(h2, "Left")
   wn.onkey(h3, "Right")
   wn.onkey(h4, "q")

   # Now we need to tell the window to start listening for events,  
   # If any of the keys that we're monitoring is pressed, its 
   # handler will be called.
   wn.listen()
   wn.mainloop()    
    
    
Here are some points to note:

* We need the call to the window's ``listen`` method at line 31, otherwise it won't notice our keypresses.
* We named our handler functions ``h1``, ``h2`` and so on, but we can choose better names.  The handlers can be
  arbitrarily complex functions that call other functions, etc. 
* Pressing the ``q`` key on the keyboard calls function ``h4`` (because we `bound` the ``q`` key to ``h4`` on line 26). 
  While executing ``h4``, the window's ``bye`` method (line 24) closes the turtle window, which causes the window's 
  mainloop call (line 31) to end its execution.  Since we did not write any more statements after line 32, this means
  that our program has completed everything, so it too will terminate.  
* We can refer to keys on the keyboard by their character code (as we did in line 26), or by their symbolic names.
  Some of the symbolic names to try are Cancel (the Break key), BackSpace, Tab, Return(the Enter key), 
  Shift_L (any Shift key), Control_L (any Control key), Alt_L (any Alt key), Pause, Caps_Lock, Escape, Prior (Page Up), 
  Next (Page Down), End, Home, Left, Up, Right, Down, Print, Insert, Delete, F1, F2, F3, F4, F5, F6, F7, F8, F9, F10, 
  F11, F12, Num_Lock, and Scroll_Lock.

Mouse events
------------
 
A mouse event is a bit different from a keypress event because its handler needs two parameters
to receive x,y coordinate information telling us where the mouse was when the event occurred. 

.. activecode:: turtlemouse
   :norun:
   
   import turtle

   turtle.setup(400,500)               
   wn = turtle.Screen()               
   wn.title("How to handle mouse clicks on the window!")  
   wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")           

   tess = turtle.Turtle()           
   tess.color("purple")
   tess.pensize(3)
   tess.shape("circle")

   def h1(x, y):
       tess.goto(x, y)

   wn.onclick(h1)  # Wire up a click on the window.
   wn.mainloop()

There is a new turtle method used at line 14 --- this allows us to move the turtle to an *absolute*
coordinate position.  (Most of the examples that we've seen so far move the turtle *relative* to where
it currently is).   So what this program does is move the turtle (and draw a line) to wherever 
the mouse is clicked.  Try it out! 

If we add this line before line 14, we'll learn a useful debugging trick too:

.. activecode:: turtletitletrick
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:

   wn.title("Got click at coords "+str(x)+","+str(y))

Because we can easily change the text in the window's title bar, it is a useful place to display
occasional debugging or status information. (Of course, this is not the real purpose of the window
title!) 

    
But there is more! 

Not only can the window receive mouse events: individual turtles can also 
have their own handlers for mouse clicks.  The turtle that 
"receives" the click event will be the one under the mouse.   So we'll create
two turtles.  Each will bind a handler to its own ``onclick`` event.  And the
two handlers can do different things for their turtles. 

.. activecode:: turtletwo
   :norun:
     
   import turtle

   turtle.setup(400,500)              # Determine the window size
   wn = turtle.Screen()               # Get a reference to the window
   wn.title("Handling mouse clicks!") # Change the window title
   wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")           # Set the background color
   tess = turtle.Turtle()             # Create two turtles
   tess.color("purple")
   alex = turtle.Turtle()             # Move them apart
   alex.color("blue")
   alex.forward(100)

   def handler_for_tess(x, y):
       wn.title("Tess clicked at "+str(x)+","+str(y))
       tess.left(42)
       tess.forward(30)

   def handler_for_alex(x, y):
       wn.title("Alex clicked at "+str(x)+","+str(y))
       alex.right(84)
       alex.forward(50)

   tess.onclick(handler_for_tess)
   alex.onclick(handler_for_alex)

   wn.mainloop()

  
Run this, click on the turtles, see what happens!


Automatic events from a timer
-----------------------------

Alarm clocks, kitchen timers, and thermonuclear bombs in James Bond movies are set to 
create an "automatic" event after a certain interval. The turtle module in Python has a 
timer that can cause an event when its time is up.

.. activecode:: turtletimer
   :norun:
   
   import turtle

   turtle.setup(400,500)
   wn = turtle.Screen()
   wn.title("Using a timer")
   wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")

   tess = turtle.Turtle()
   tess.color("purple")
   tess.pensize(3)

   def h1():
       tess.forward(100)
       tess.left(56)

   wn.ontimer(h1, 2000)
   wn.mainloop()
    
On line 16 the timer is started and set to explode in 2000 milliseconds (2 seconds). When the event does occur,
the handler is called, and tess springs into action.  

Unfortunately, when one sets a timer, it only goes off once. So a common idiom, or style, is to restart
the timer inside the handler.  In this way the timer will keep on giving new events.  Try this program:

.. activecode:: turtlerepeattimer
   :norun:
   
   import turtle

   turtle.setup(400,500)
   wn = turtle.Screen()
   wn.title("Using a timer to get events!")
   wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")

   tess = turtle.Turtle()
   tess.color("purple")

   def h1():
       tess.forward(100)
       tess.left(56)
       wn.ontimer(h1, 60)

   h1()
   wn.mainloop()

An example: state machines
--------------------------

A state machine is a system that can be in one of a few different `states`. We draw a 
state diagram to represent the machine, where each state is drawn as a circle or an ellipse.
Certain events occur which cause the system to leave one state and `transition` into a 
different state.  These `state transitions` are usually drawn as an arrow on the diagram.

This idea is not new: when first turning on a cellphone, it goes into a
state which we could call "Awaiting PIN".  When the correct PIN is entered, it 
transitions into a different state --- say "Ready".  Then we could lock the phone, and it
would enter a "Locked" state, and so on.

A simple state machine that we encounter often is a traffic light.  Here 
is a state diagram which shows that the machine continually cycles through three different
states, which we've numbered 0, 1 and 2.

    .. image::  illustrations/fsm_traffic_lights.png
 
We're going to build a program that uses a turtle to simulate the traffic lights.
There are three lessons here. The first shows off some different ways to use our turtles.
The second demonstrates how we would program a state machine in Python, by using a variable
to keep track of the current state, and a number of different ``if`` statements to 
inspect the current state, and take the actions as we change to a different state.
The third lesson is to use events from the keyboard to trigger the state changes.
  
Copy and run this program.  Make sure you understand what each line does, consulting the 
documentation as you need to.   
   
.. activecode:: trafficlight
   :norun:
  
   import turtle         # Tess becomes a traffic light.

   turtle.setup(400,500)
   wn = turtle.Screen()
   wn.title("Tess becomes a traffic light!")
   wn.bgcolor("lightgreen")
   tess = turtle.Turtle()
   
   def draw_housing():
       """ Draw a nice housing to hold the traffic lights """
       tess.pensize(3)
       tess.color("black", "darkgrey")
       tess.begin_fill()
       tess.forward(80)
       tess.left(90)
       tess.forward(200)
       tess.circle(40, 180)
       tess.forward(200)
       tess.left(90)
       tess.end_fill()
      
   draw_housing()

   tess.penup()
   # Position tess onto the place where the green light should be
   tess.forward(40)
   tess.left(90)
   tess.forward(50)
   # Turn tess into a big green circle
   tess.shape("circle")
   tess.shapesize(3)
   tess.fillcolor("green")

   # A traffic light is a kind of state machine with three states,
   # Green, Yellow, Red.  We number these states  0, 1, 2
   # When the machine changes state, we change tess' position and
   # her fillcolor. 

   # This variable holds the current state of the machine
   stateNum = 0

   def advance_state_machine():
       global stateNum
       if stateNum == 0:      # Transition from state 0 to state 1
          tess.forward(70)
          tess.fillcolor("yellow")
          stateNum = 1
       elif stateNum == 1:    # Transition from state 1 to state 2
          tess.forward(70)
          tess.fillcolor("red")
          stateNum = 2
       else:                  # Transition from state 2 to state 0
          tess.back(140)
          tess.fillcolor("green")
          stateNum = 0

   # Bind the event handler to the space key.
   wn.onkey(advance_state_machine, "space")  

   wn.listen()                 # Listen for events
   wn.mainloop()

The new Python statement is at line 43.  The ``global`` keyword tells Python not to 
create a new local variable for ``stateNum`` (in spite of the fact that 
the function assigns to this variable at lines 47, 51, and 55).  Instead, in this function, 
``stateNum`` always refers to the variable that was created at line 40.

What the code in ``advance_state_machine`` does is advance from whatever
the current state is, to the next state.  On the state change we move tess 
to her new position, change her color, and, of course, we assign to ``stateNum`` 
the number of the new state we've just entered. 

Each time the space bar is pressed, the event handler causes the traffic light
machine to move to its new state.
 
    
    
Glossary
--------

.. glossary::

    bind
        We bind a function (or associate it) with an event, meaning that when the event occurs, the
        function is called to handle it.        

    event
        Something that happens "outside" the normal control flow of our program, usually from some user action.
        Typical events are mouse operations and keypresses.  We've also seen that a timer can be primed 
        to create an event.

    handler
        A function that is called in response to an event.
