Foreword-AoPS Edition
=====================

Welcome to the AoPS Edition of *How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3*!

This ebook is designed for use with the Art of Problem Solving's `Introduction to Programming with Python <http://www.artofproblemsolving.com/School/courseinfo.php?course_id=python1>`__ course. We assume that students taking the course have no prior programming experience.

This ebook merges material from two sources:

* The open-source textbook *How to Think Like a Computer Scientist: Learning with Python 3 (RLE)*, by Peter Wentworth, Jeffrey Elkner, Allen B. Downey, and Chris Meyers. This book is available at http://openbookproject.net/thinkcs/python/english3e/
* The *Runestone Interactive* tools, by the Runestone Interactive Project at Luther University. These tools are available at http://interactivepython.org

We have, by and large, taken the text from the first source above and added the interactive tools from the second source. This means that the people listed above did 90% of the work for us, and for that we are very grateful. Our work consisted mostly of making some edits of the book's content to make it more suitable for our AoPS audience, and modifying the interactive tools to make them more compatible with the AoPS website.

If you have any comments about this ebook, or if you have any errors to report, please send them to classes@artofproblemsolving.com.
