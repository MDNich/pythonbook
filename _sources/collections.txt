Collections of Objects
======================


Composition
-----------

By now, we have seen several examples of composition. One of the first
examples was using a method invocation as part of an expression.  Another
example is the nested structure of statements; we can put an ``if`` statement
within a ``while`` loop, within another ``if`` statement, and so on.

Having seen this pattern, and having learned about lists and objects, we
should not be surprised to learn that we can create lists of objects. We can
also create objects that contain lists (as attributes); we can create lists
that contain lists; we can create objects that contain objects; and so on.

In this chapter and the next, we will look at some examples of these
combinations, using ``Card`` objects as an example.


``Card`` objects
----------------

If you are not familiar with common playing cards, now would be a good time to
get a deck, or else this chapter might not make much sense.  There are
fifty-two cards in a deck, each of which belongs to one of four suits and one
of thirteen ranks. The suits are Spades, Hearts, Diamonds, and Clubs (in
descending order in bridge). The ranks are Ace, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10,
Jack, Queen, and King. Depending on the game that we are playing, the rank of
Ace may be higher than King or lower than 2.  
The rank is sometimes called the face-value of the card.

If we want to define a new object to represent a playing card, it is obvious
what the attributes should be: ``rank`` and ``suit``. It is not as obvious what
type the attributes should be. One possibility is to use strings containing
words like ``"Spade"`` for suits and ``"Queen"`` for ranks. One problem with
this implementation is that it would not be easy to compare cards to see which
had a higher rank or suit.

An alternative is to use integers to **encode** the ranks and suits.  By
encode, we do not mean what some people think, which is to encrypt or translate
into a secret code. What a computer scientist means by encode is to define a
mapping between a sequence of numbers and the items we want to represent. For
example:

    .. sourcecode:: python3
        
        Spades   -->  3
        Hearts   -->  2
        Diamonds -->  1
        Clubs    -->  0

An obvious feature of this mapping is that the suits map to integers in order,
so we can compare suits by comparing integers. The mapping for ranks is fairly
obvious; each of the numerical ranks maps to the corresponding integer, and for
face cards:

    .. sourcecode:: python3
        
        Jack   -->  11
        Queen  -->  12
        King   -->  13

The reason we are using mathematical notation for these mappings is that they
are not part of the Python program. They are part of the program design, but
they never appear explicitly in the code. The class definition for the ``Card``
type looks like this:

.. activecode:: carddef
   :norun:
        
   class Card:
   
       def __init__(self, suit=0, rank=0):
           self.suit = suit
           self.rank = rank

As usual, we provide an initialization method that takes an optional parameter
for each attribute.

To create some objects, representing say the 3 of Clubs and the Jack of Diamonds, use these commands:

.. activecode:: carddefexs
   :norun:
        
   class Card:
   
       def __init__(self, suit=0, rank=0):
           self.suit = suit
           self.rank = rank

   threeOfClubs = Card(0, 3)
   jackOfDiamonds = Card(1, 11)

In the first case above, for example, the first argument, ``0``, represents the suit Clubs.


Class attributes and the ``__str__`` method
-------------------------------------------

In order to print ``Card`` objects in a way that people can easily read, we
want to map the integer codes onto words. A natural way to do that is with
lists of strings. We assign these lists to **class attributes** at the top of
the class definition:

.. activecode:: cardattribs
        
   class Card:
       suits = ["Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"]
       ranks = ["narf", "Ace", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7",
                "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King"]
   
       def __init__(self, suit=0, rank=0):
           self.suit = suit
           self.rank = rank
            
       def __str__(self):
           return (self.ranks[self.rank] + " of " + self.suits[self.suit])

   threeOfClubs = Card(0, 3)
   print(threeOfClubs)
   jackOfDiamonds = Card(1, 11)
   print(jackOfDiamonds)

A class attribute is defined outside of any method, and it can be accessed from
any of the methods in the class. 

Inside ``__str__``, we can use ``suits`` and ``ranks`` to map the numerical
values of ``suit`` and ``rank`` to strings. For example, the expression
``self.suits[self.suit]`` means use the attribute ``suit`` from the object
``self`` as an index into the class attribute named ``suits``, and select the
appropriate string.

The reason for the ``"narf"`` in the first element in ``ranks`` is to act as a
place keeper for the zero-eth element of the list, which will never be used.
The only valid ranks are 1 to 13. This wasted item is not entirely necessary.
We could have started at 0, as usual, but it is less confusing to encode the
rank 2 as integer 2, 3 as 3, and so on.

Class attributes like ``suits`` are shared by all ``Card`` objects. The
advantage of this is that we can use any ``Card`` object to access the class
attributes:

.. activecode:: cardattribaccess
        
   class Card:
       suits = ["Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"]
       ranks = ["narf", "Ace", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7",
                "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King"]
   
       def __init__(self, suit=0, rank=0):
           self.suit = suit
           self.rank = rank
            
       def __str__(self):
           return (self.ranks[self.rank] + " of " + self.suits[self.suit])

   threeOfClubs = Card(0, 3)
   print(threeOfClubs)
   jackOfDiamonds = Card(1, 11)
   print(jackOfDiamonds)
   print(jackOfDiamonds.suits[2])  # should print Hearts

Because every ``Card`` instance references the same class attribute, we have an
aliasing situation.  The disadvantage is that if we modify a class attribute, it affects every
instance of the class. For example, if we decide that Jack of Diamonds should
really be called Jack of Swirly Whales, we could do this:

.. activecode:: cardattribmodify
        
   class Card:
       suits = ["Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"]
       ranks = ["narf", "Ace", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7",
                "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King"]
   
       def __init__(self, suit=0, rank=0):
           self.suit = suit
           self.rank = rank
            
       def __str__(self):
           return (self.ranks[self.rank] + " of " + self.suits[self.suit])

   threeOfClubs = Card(0, 3)
   jackOfDiamonds = Card(1, 11)
   jackOfDiamonds.suits[1] = "Swirly Whales"
   print(jackOfDiamonds)

The problem is that *all* of the Diamonds just became Swirly Whales. So we have an issue in the following example:

.. activecode:: cardattriboops
        
   class Card:
       suits = ["Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"]
       ranks = ["narf", "Ace", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7",
                "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King"]
   
       def __init__(self, suit=0, rank=0):
           self.suit = suit
           self.rank = rank
            
       def __str__(self):
           return (self.ranks[self.rank] + " of " + self.suits[self.suit])

   card1 = Card(1, 11)  # Jack of Diamonds
   card2 = Card(1, 3)   # 3 of Diamonds
   card1.suits[1] = "Swirly Whales"   # changes card1 to Jack of Swirly Whales
   print(card1)
   print(card2)  # card2's suit got changed too!

For this reason, it is usually not a good idea to modify class attributes.


Comparing cards
---------------

For primitive types, there are six relational operators ( ``<``, ``>``, ``==``,
etc.) that compare values and determine when one is greater than, less than, or
equal to another.   If we want our own types to be comparable using the syntax
of these relational operators, we need to define six corresponding special methods
in our class.

We'd like to start with a single method named ``cmp`` that houses the logic of ordering.
By convention, a comparison method takes two parameters, ``self`` and ``other``, 
and returns 1 if the first object is greater, -1 if the second object is greater, 
and 0 if they are equal to each other.

Some types are completely ordered, which means that we can compare any two
elements and tell which is bigger. For example, the integers and the
floating-point numbers are completely ordered. Some types are unordered, which
means that there is no meaningful way to say that one element is bigger than
another. For example, the fruits are unordered, which is why we cannot compare
apples and oranges, and we cannot meaningfully order a collection of images, 
or a collection of cellphones.

Playing cards are partially ordered, which means that sometimes we
can compare cards and sometimes not. For example, we know that the 3 of Clubs
is higher than the 2 of Clubs, and the 3 of Diamonds is higher than the 3 of
Clubs. But which is better, the 3 of Clubs or the 2 of Diamonds? One has a
higher rank, but the other has a higher suit.

In order to make cards comparable, we have to decide which is more important,
rank or suit. To be honest, the choice is arbitrary. For the sake of choosing,
we will say that suit is more important, because a new deck of cards comes
sorted with all the Clubs together, followed by all the Diamonds, and so on.

With that decided, we can write ``cmp``:

.. activecode:: cardcmp
        
   class Card:
       suits = ["Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"]
       ranks = ["narf", "Ace", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7",
                "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King"]
   
       def __init__(self, suit=0, rank=0):
           self.suit = suit
           self.rank = rank
            
       def __str__(self):
           return (self.ranks[self.rank] + " of " + self.suits[self.suit])
        
       def cmp(self, other):
           # Check the suits
           if self.suit > other.suit: 
               return 1
           if self.suit < other.suit:
               return -1
           # Suits are the same... check ranks
           if self.rank > other.rank:
               return 1
           if self.rank < other.rank:
               return -1
           # Ranks are the same... it's a tie
           return 0

In this ordering, Aces appear lower than Deuces (2s).

Now, we can define the six special methods that do the
overloading of each of the relational operators for us.
With this machinery in place, the relational operators now work as we'd like them to:

.. activecode:: cardreloverload
        
   class Card:
       suits = ["Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"]
       ranks = ["narf", "Ace", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7",
                "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King"]
   
       def __init__(self, suit=0, rank=0):
           self.suit = suit
           self.rank = rank
            
       def __str__(self):
           return (self.ranks[self.rank] + " of " + self.suits[self.suit])
        
       def cmp(self, other):
           # Check the suits
           if self.suit > other.suit: 
               return 1
           if self.suit < other.suit:
               return -1
           # Suits are the same... check ranks
           if self.rank > other.rank:
               return 1
           if self.rank < other.rank:
               return -1
           # Ranks are the same... it's a tie
           return 0
        
       def __eq__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) == 0

       def __le__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) <= 0

       def __ge__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) >= 0

       def __gt__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) > 0

       def __lt__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) < 0

       def __ne__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) != 0        

   card1 = Card(1, 11)  # Jack of Diamonds
   card2 = Card(1, 3)   # 3 of Diamonds
   card3 = Card(1, 11)  # Jack of Diamonds
   print(card1 < card2)  # should be False
   print(card1 == card3) # should be True


Decks
-----

Now that we have objects to represent ``Card``\s, the next logical step is to
define a class to represent a ``Deck``. Of course, a deck is made up of cards,
so each ``Deck`` object will contain a list of cards as an attribute.  Many card
games will need at least two different decks --- a red deck and a blue deck.

The following is a class definition for the ``Deck`` class. The initialization
method creates the attribute ``cards`` and generates the standard pack of
fifty-two cards:

.. activecode:: deckinit
        
   class Card:
       suits = ["Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"]
       ranks = ["narf", "Ace", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7",
                "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King"]
   
       def __init__(self, suit=0, rank=0):
           self.suit = suit
           self.rank = rank
            
       def __str__(self):
           return (self.ranks[self.rank] + " of " + self.suits[self.suit])
        
       def cmp(self, other):
           # Check the suits
           if self.suit > other.suit: 
               return 1
           if self.suit < other.suit:
               return -1
           # Suits are the same... check ranks
           if self.rank > other.rank:
               return 1
           if self.rank < other.rank:
               return -1
           # Ranks are the same... it's a tie
           return 0
        
       def __eq__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) == 0

       def __le__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) <= 0

       def __ge__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) >= 0

       def __gt__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) > 0

       def __lt__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) < 0

       def __ne__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) != 0        
        
   class Deck:
            
       def __init__(self):
           self.cards = []
           for suit in range(4):
               for rank in range(1, 14):
                   self.cards.append(Card(suit, rank))

The easiest way to populate the deck is with a nested loop. The outer loop
enumerates the suits from 0 to 3. The inner loop enumerates the ranks from 1 to
13. Since the outer loop iterates four times, and the inner loop iterates
thirteen times, the total number of times the body is executed is fifty-two
(thirteen times four). Each iteration creates a new instance of ``Card`` with
the current suit and rank, and appends that card to the ``cards`` list.

As usual, when we define a new type we want a method that prints the
contents of an instance. To print a ``Deck``, we traverse the list and print each
``Card``:

.. activecode:: deckprint
        
   class Card:
       suits = ["Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"]
       ranks = ["narf", "Ace", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7",
                "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King"]
   
       def __init__(self, suit=0, rank=0):
           self.suit = suit
           self.rank = rank
            
       def __str__(self):
           return (self.ranks[self.rank] + " of " + self.suits[self.suit])
        
       def cmp(self, other):
           # Check the suits
           if self.suit > other.suit: 
               return 1
           if self.suit < other.suit:
               return -1
           # Suits are the same... check ranks
           if self.rank > other.rank:
               return 1
           if self.rank < other.rank:
               return -1
           # Ranks are the same... it's a tie
           return 0
        
       def __eq__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) == 0

       def __le__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) <= 0

       def __ge__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) >= 0

       def __gt__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) > 0

       def __lt__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) < 0

       def __ne__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) != 0        
        
   class Deck:
            
       def __init__(self):
           self.cards = []
           for suit in range(4):
               for rank in range(1, 14):
                   self.cards.append(Card(suit, rank))

       def print_deck(self):
           for card in self.cards:
               print(card)

As an alternative to ``print_deck``, we could write a ``__str__`` method for
the ``Deck`` class. The advantage of ``__str__`` is that it is more flexible.
Rather than just printing the contents of the object, it generates a string
representation that other parts of the program can manipulate before printing,
or store for later use. Here is a version of ``__str__`` that returns a string representation of a ``Deck``. 

.. activecode:: deckstr
        
   class Card:
       suits = ["Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"]
       ranks = ["narf", "Ace", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7",
                "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King"]
   
       def __init__(self, suit=0, rank=0):
           self.suit = suit
           self.rank = rank
            
       def __str__(self):
           return (self.ranks[self.rank] + " of " + self.suits[self.suit])
        
       def cmp(self, other):
           # Check the suits
           if self.suit > other.suit: 
               return 1
           if self.suit < other.suit:
               return -1
           # Suits are the same... check ranks
           if self.rank > other.rank:
               return 1
           if self.rank < other.rank:
               return -1
           # Ranks are the same... it's a tie
           return 0
        
       def __eq__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) == 0

       def __le__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) <= 0

       def __ge__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) >= 0

       def __gt__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) > 0

       def __lt__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) < 0

       def __ne__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) != 0        
        
   class Deck:
            
       def __init__(self):
           self.cards = []
           for suit in range(4):
               for rank in range(1, 14):
                   self.cards.append(Card(suit, rank))

       def __str__(self):
           s = ""
           for card in self.cards:
               s += str(card) + '\n'
           return s

Notice we are using the variable ``s`` as an **accumulator**.  Initially,
``s`` is the empty string. Each time through the loop, a new string is
generated and concatenated with the old value of ``s`` to get the new value.

Also note that we can calling the ``str`` function on the cards in our deck. 
Recall that ``str`` is equivalent to invoking the ``__str__`` method on the object.

When the loop ends, ``s`` contains the complete string representation of the
``Deck``. We can try it out:

Shuffling the deck
------------------

If a deck is perfectly shuffled, then any card is equally likely to appear
anywhere in the deck, and any location in the deck is equally likely to contain
any card.

To shuffle the deck, we will use the ``randrange`` function from the ``random``
module. With two integer arguments, ``a`` and ``b``, ``randrange`` chooses a
random integer in the range ``a <= x < b``. Since the upper bound is strictly
less than ``b``, we can use the length of a list as the second parameter, and
we are guaranteed to get a legal index. For example, if ``rng`` has already
been instantiated as a random number source, this expression chooses
the index of a random card in a deck:

.. activecode:: randrangeex
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:
        
   rng.randrange(0, len(self.cards))

An easy way to shuffle the deck is by traversing the cards and swapping each
card with a randomly chosen one. It is possible that the card will be swapped
with itself, but that is fine. In fact, if we precluded that possibility, the
order of the cards would be less than entirely random:

.. activecode:: deckshuffle
        
   class Card:
       suits = ["Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"]
       ranks = ["narf", "Ace", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7",
                "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King"]
   
       def __init__(self, suit=0, rank=0):
           self.suit = suit
           self.rank = rank
            
       def __str__(self):
           return (self.ranks[self.rank] + " of " + self.suits[self.suit])
        
       def cmp(self, other):
           # Check the suits
           if self.suit > other.suit: 
               return 1
           if self.suit < other.suit:
               return -1
           # Suits are the same... check ranks
           if self.rank > other.rank:
               return 1
           if self.rank < other.rank:
               return -1
           # Ranks are the same... it's a tie
           return 0
        
       def __eq__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) == 0

       def __le__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) <= 0

       def __ge__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) >= 0

       def __gt__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) > 0

       def __lt__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) < 0

       def __ne__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) != 0        
        
   class Deck:
            
       def __init__(self):
           self.cards = []
           for suit in range(4):
               for rank in range(1, 14):
                   self.cards.append(Card(suit, rank))

       def __str__(self):
           s = ""
           for card in self.cards:
               s += str(card) + '\n'
           return s

       def shuffle(self):
           import random      
           numCards = len(self.cards)
           for i in range(numCards):
               j = random.randrange(i, numCards)  # pick a card to swap with i
               (self.cards[i], self.cards[j]) = (self.cards[j], self.cards[i])

   myDeck = Deck()
   myDeck.shuffle()
   print(myDeck)                          


Rather than assume that there are fifty-two cards in the deck, we get the
actual length of the list and store it in ``numCards``.

For each card in the deck, we choose a random card from among the cards that
haven't been shuffled yet. Then we swap the current card (``i``) with the
selected card (``j``). To swap the cards we use a tuple assignment.
    
While this is a good shuffling method, a random number generator object also
has a ``shuffle`` method that can shuffle elements in a list, in place.
So we could rewrite this function to use the one provided for us:     
    
.. activecode:: decknewshuffle
        
   class Card:
       suits = ["Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"]
       ranks = ["narf", "Ace", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7",
                "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King"]
   
       def __init__(self, suit=0, rank=0):
           self.suit = suit
           self.rank = rank
            
       def __str__(self):
           return (self.ranks[self.rank] + " of " + self.suits[self.suit])
        
       def cmp(self, other):
           # Check the suits
           if self.suit > other.suit: 
               return 1
           if self.suit < other.suit:
               return -1
           # Suits are the same... check ranks
           if self.rank > other.rank:
               return 1
           if self.rank < other.rank:
               return -1
           # Ranks are the same... it's a tie
           return 0
        
       def __eq__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) == 0

       def __le__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) <= 0

       def __ge__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) >= 0

       def __gt__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) > 0

       def __lt__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) < 0

       def __ne__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) != 0        
        
   class Deck:
            
       def __init__(self):
           self.cards = []
           for suit in range(4):
               for rank in range(1, 14):
                   self.cards.append(Card(suit, rank))

       def __str__(self):
           s = ""
           for card in self.cards:
               s += str(card) + '\n'
           return s

       def shuffle(self):
           import random
           random.shuffle(self.cards)

   myDeck = Deck()
   myDeck.shuffle()
   print(myDeck)                          
            

Removing and dealing cards
--------------------------

Another method that would be useful for the ``Deck`` class is ``remove``,
which takes a card as a parameter, removes it, and returns ``True`` if
the card was in the deck and ``False`` otherwise:

.. activecode:: deckremove
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:
        
   class Deck:
       ...
       def remove(self, card):
           if card in self.cards:
               self.cards.remove(card)
               return True 
           else:
               return False 

The ``in`` operator returns ``True`` if the first operand is in the second. 
If the first operand is an object, Python uses
the object's ``__eq__`` method to determine equality with items in the list.
Since the ``__eq__`` we provided in the ``Card`` class checks for deep equality, the
``remove`` method checks for deep equality.

To deal cards, we want to remove and return the top card. The list method
``pop`` provides a convenient way to do that:

.. activecode:: deckpop
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:
        
   class Deck:
       ...
       def pop(self):
           return self.cards.pop()

Actually, ``pop`` removes the *last* card in the list, so we are in effect
dealing from the bottom of the deck.

One more operation that we are likely to want is the Boolean function
``is_empty``, which returns ``True`` if the deck contains no cards:

.. activecode:: deckisempty
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:
        
   class Deck:
       ...
       def is_empty(self):
           return self.cards == []

Here is our entire class with these methods added:

.. activecode:: deckfinal
        
   class Card:
       suits = ["Clubs", "Diamonds", "Hearts", "Spades"]
       ranks = ["narf", "Ace", "2", "3", "4", "5", "6", "7",
                "8", "9", "10", "Jack", "Queen", "King"]
   
       def __init__(self, suit=0, rank=0):
           self.suit = suit
           self.rank = rank
            
       def __str__(self):
           return (self.ranks[self.rank] + " of " + self.suits[self.suit])
        
       def cmp(self, other):
           # Check the suits
           if self.suit > other.suit: 
               return 1
           if self.suit < other.suit:
               return -1
           # Suits are the same... check ranks
           if self.rank > other.rank:
               return 1
           if self.rank < other.rank:
               return -1
           # Ranks are the same... it's a tie
           return 0
        
       def __eq__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) == 0

       def __le__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) <= 0

       def __ge__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) >= 0

       def __gt__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) > 0

       def __lt__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) < 0

       def __ne__(self, other):
           return self.cmp(other) != 0        
        
   class Deck:
            
       def __init__(self):
           self.cards = []
           for suit in range(4):
               for rank in range(1, 14):
                   self.cards.append(Card(suit, rank))

       def __str__(self):
           s = ""
           for card in self.cards:
               s += str(card) + '\n'
           return s

       def shuffle(self):
           import random
           random.shuffle(self.cards)

       def remove(self, card):
           if card in self.cards:
               self.cards.remove(card)
               return True 
           else:
               return False 

       def pop(self):
           return self.cards.pop()

       def is_empty(self):
           return self.cards == []

   # testing
   myDeck = Deck()
   myDeck.shuffle()
   card1 = myDeck.pop()  # deal a card
   print(card1)
   print(myDeck.remove(card1))  # should print False becuase card was already dealt
