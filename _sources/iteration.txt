.. index:: iteration, assignment, assignment statement 

.. index::
    single: statement; assignment
   
    
Computers are often used to automate repetitive tasks. Repeating identical or
similar tasks without making errors is something that computers do well and
people do poorly.

Repeated execution of a set of statements is called **iteration**.  Because
iteration is so common, Python provides several language features to make it
easier. We've already seen the ``for`` statement: this the 
the form of iteration you'll likely be using most often.  But in this chapter
we've going to look at the ``while`` statement: another way to have your
program do iteration, useful in slightly different circumstances.

Before we do that, let's just review a few ideas...

Assignment
---------- 

As we have mentioned previously, it is legal to make more than one assignment to the
same variable. A new assignment makes an existing variable refer to a new value
(and stop referring to the old value).

.. activecode:: variablereassign
	
   airtime_remaining = 15
   print(airtime_remaining)
   airtime_remaining = 7
   print(airtime_remaining)

The first time ``airtime_remaining`` is
printed, its value is 15, and the second time, its value is 7.  

It is especially important to distinguish between an
assignment statement and a Boolean expression that tests for equality. 
Because Python uses the equal token (``=``) for assignment, 
it is tempting to interpret a statement like
``a = b`` as a Boolean test.  Unlike mathematics, it is not!  Remember that the Python token
for the equality operator is ``==``.

Note too that an equality test is symmetric, but assignment is not. For example, 
if ``a == 7`` then ``7 == a``. But in Python, the statement ``a = 7``
is legal and ``7 = a`` is not.

In Python, an assignment statement can make
two variables equal, but because further assignments can change either of them, 
they don't have to stay that way:

.. activecode:: twovariablesresassign
        
   a = 5
   b = a    # After executing this line, a and b are now equal
   print("a="+str(a)+" b="+str(b))
   a = 3    # After executing this line, a and b are no longer equal
   print("a="+str(a)+" b="+str(b))

Line 4 changes the value of ``a`` but does not change the value of
``b``, so they are no longer equal. Some 
people also think that *variable* was an unfortunate word to choose, and instead  
we should have called them *assignables*.  Python chooses to 
follow common terminology and token usage, also found in languages like C, C++, Java, and C#,
so we use the tokens ``=`` for assignment, ``==`` for equality, and we talk of *variables*.


Updating variables
------------------

When an assignment statement is executed, the right-hand side expression (i.e. the 
expression that comes after the assignment token) is evaluated first.  This produces a value. 
Then the assignment is made, so that the variable on the left-hand side now refers
to the new value.

One of the most common forms of assignment is an update, where the new
value of the variable depends on its old value.   Deduct 40 cents from
my airtime balance, or add one run to the scoreboard. 

.. activecode:: simpleupdateexample
        
   n = 5
   n = 3 * n + 1
   print(n)

Line 2 means *get the current value of n, multiply it by three and add
one, and assign the answer to n, thus making n refer to the value*.  
So after executing the two lines above, ``n`` will point/refer to the
integer 16.

If you try to get the value of a variable that has never been assigned to, you'll get an error:

    .. code-block:: none
        
       >>> w = x + 1
       Traceback (most recent call last):
         File "<pyshell#0>", line 1, in <module>
           w=x+1
       NameError: name 'x' is not defined

Before you can update a variable, you have to **initialize** it to some starting value, 
usually with a simple assignment:

    .. code-block:: none
        
       runs_scored = 0
       ...
       runs_scored = runs_scored + 1

This sort of assignment --- updating a variable by adding 1 to it --- is very common.  
It is called an **increment** of the variable; subtracting 1 is called a **decrement**.  
Sometimes programmers also talk about *bumping* a variable, which means the same 
as incrementing it by 1.

.. index:: for loop

The ``for`` loop revisited
--------------------------

Recall that the ``for`` loop processes each item in a list.  Each item in
turn is (re-)assigned to the loop variable, and the body of the loop is executed.
We saw this example in an earlier chapter:

.. activecode:: partyinviteredux

   for f in ["Joe", "Zoe", "Brad", "Angelina", "Zuki", "Thandi", "Paris"]:
       invitation = "Hi " + f + ".  Please come to my party on Saturday!"
       print(invitation) 
        
Running through all the items in a list is called **traversing** the list,
or **traversal**.      

Let us write a function now to sum up all the elements in a list of numbers.
Do this by hand first, and try to isolate exactly what steps you take.  You'll
find you need to keep some "running total" of the sum so far, either on a piece 
of paper, in your head, or in your calculator. Remembering things from one step to the next is
precisely why we have variables in a program: so we'll need some variable
to remember the "running total".  It should be initialized with a value of zero,
and then we need to traverse the items in the list.  For each item, we'll want
to update the running total by adding the next number to it.

.. activecode:: sumalistexample

   def mysum(xs):
       """ Sum all the numbers in the list xs, and return the total. """
       running_total = 0
       for x in xs:
          running_total = running_total + x
       return running_total

   # Add tests like these to your test suite ...
   print(mysum([1, 2, 3, 4])) # should be 10
   print(mysum([1.25, 2.5, 1.75])) # should be 5.5
   print(mysum([1, -2, 3])) # should be 2
   print(mysum([ ])) # should be 0
   print(mysum(range(11))) # should be 0+1+2+...+10 = 55
      
        
.. index:: while statement, while loop, iteration, loop, loop body,
           infinite loop, condition

The ``while`` statement
-----------------------

Here is a fragment of code that demonstrates the use of the ``while`` statement:

.. activecode:: whilefirstexample

   def sum_to(n):
       """ Return the sum of 1+2+3+...+n """
       ss  = 0
       v = 1
       while v <= n:
           ss = ss + v
           v = v + 1
       return ss

   # For your test suite
   print(sum_to(4))
   print(sum_to(1000))

You can almost read the ``while`` statement as if it were English. It means,
while ``v`` is less than or equal to ``n``, continue executing the body of the loop. Within
the body, each time, increment ``v``. When ``v`` passes ``n``, return your accumulated sum.

More formally, here is precise flow of execution for a ``while`` statement:

* Evaluate the condition at line 5, yielding a value which is either ``False`` or ``True``.
* If the value is ``False``, exit the ``while`` statement and continue
  execution at the next statement (line 8 in this case).
* If the value is ``True``, execute each of the statements in the body (lines 6 and 7) and
  then go back to the ``while`` statement at line 5.

The body consists of all of the statements indented below the ``while`` keyword.  

Notice that if the loop condition is ``False`` the first time we get 
loop, the statements in the body of the loop are never executed.

The body of the loop should change the value of one or more variables so that
eventually the condition becomes false and the loop terminates. Otherwise the
loop will repeat forever, which is called an **infinite loop**. An endless
source of amusement for computer scientists is the observation that the
directions on shampoo, "lather, rinse, repeat", are an infinite loop.

In the case here, we can prove that the loop terminates because we
know that the value of ``n`` is finite, and we can see that the value of ``v``
increments each time through the loop, so eventually it will have to exceed ``n``. In
other cases, it is not so easy, even impossible in some cases, 
to tell if the loop will ever terminate.  

What you will notice here is that the ``while`` loop is more work for
you --- the programmer --- than the equivalent ``for`` loop.  When using a ``while``
loop one has to manage the loop variable yourself: give it an initial value, test
for completion, and then make sure you change something in the body so that the loop
terminates.  By comparison, here is an equivalent function that uses ``for`` instead: 

.. activecode:: betterwithoutwhile

   def sum_to(n):
       """ Return the sum of 1+2+3+...+n """
       ss  = 0
       for v in range(n+1):
           ss = ss + v
       return ss

   print(sum_to(4))
   print(sum_to(1000))

Notice the slightly tricky call to the ``range`` function --- we had to add one onto ``n``, 
because ``range`` generates its list up to but excluding the value you give it.  
It would be easy to make a programming mistake and overlook this, but because we've
made the investment of writing some unit tests, our test suite would have caught our error.        
        
So why have two kinds of loop if ``for`` looks easier?  This next example shows a case where
we need the extra power that we get from the ``while`` loop.        
        
.. index:: Collatz 3n + 1 sequence        
        
The Collatz 3n + 1 sequence
---------------------------

Let's look at a simple sequence that has fascinated mathematicians for many years.
They still cannot answer even quite simple questions about this.  

The rule for creating the sequence is to start from
some given ``n``, and to generate
the next term of the sequence from ``n``, either by halving ``n`` 
(whenever ``n`` is even), or else by multiplying it by three and adding 1 (whenever ``n`` is odd).  The sequence
terminates when ``n`` reaches 1. 

This Python function captures that algorithm:

.. activecode:: collatz
        
   def seq_3n_plus_1(n):
       """ Print the 3n+1 sequence from n, 
           terminating when it reaches 1.
       """
       while n != 1:
           print(n, end=", ")
           if n % 2 == 0:        # n is even
               n = n // 2
           else:                 # n is odd
               n = n * 3 + 1
       print(n, end=".\n")     

   seq_3n_plus_1(3)
   seq_3n_plus_1(19)

Notice first that the print function on line 6 has an extra argument ``end=", "``.  This 
tells the ``print`` function to follow the printed string with whatever the programmer
chooses (in this case, a comma followed by a space), instead of ending the line. So
each time something is printed in the loop, it is printed on the same output line, with
the numbers separated by commas.  The call to ``print(n, end=".\n")`` at line 11 after the loop terminates
will then print the final value of ``n`` followed by a period and a newline character. 
(You'll cover the ``\n`` (newline character) in the next chapter).             
                
The condition for continuing with this loop is ``n != 1``, so the loop will continue running until
it reaches its termination condition, (i.e. ``n == 1``).

Each time through the loop, the program outputs the value of ``n`` and then
checks whether it is even or odd. If it is even, the value of ``n`` is divided
by 2 using integer division. If it is odd, the value is replaced by ``n * 3 + 1``.  Try some examples to see how the sequence behaves for different inputs.
    
Since ``n`` sometimes increases and sometimes decreases, there is no obvious
proof that ``n`` will ever reach 1, or that the program terminates. For some
particular values of ``n``, we can prove termination. For example, if the
starting value is a power of two, then the value of ``n`` will be even each
time through the loop until it reaches 1. The previous example ends with such a
sequence, starting with 16.

See if you can find a small starting 
number that needs more than a hundred steps before it terminates.

Particular values aside, the interesting question was first posed by a German 
mathematician called Lothar Collatz: the *Collatz conjecture* (also known as
the *3n + 1 conjecture*), is that this sequence terminates for *all* positive 
values of ``n``.  So far, no one has been able to prove it *or* disprove it!  
(A conjecture is a statement that might be true, but nobody knows for sure.) 

Think carefully about what would be needed for a proof or disproof of the conjecture
*"All positive integers will eventually converge to 1 using the Collatz rules"*.  
With fast computers we have been able to test every integer up to very 
large values, and so far, they have all eventually ended up at 1.  
But who knows? Perhaps there is some as-yet untested number which does not reduce to 1.   

You'll notice that if you don't stop when you reach 1, the sequence gets into
its own cyclic loop:  1, 4, 2, 1, 4, 2, 1, 4 ...   So one possibility is that there might
be other cycles that we just haven't found yet.  

Wikipedia has an informative article about the Collatz conjecture. There's also a humorous take on the Collatz conjecture at http://imgs.xkcd.com/comics/collatz_conjecture.png. The sequence 
also goes under other names (Hailstone sequence, Wonderous numbers, etc.),
and you'll find out just how many integers have already been tested by computer,
and found to converge! 
 

.. admonition:: Choosing between ``for`` and ``while``

   Use a ``for`` loop if you know, before you start looping, 
   the maximum number of times that you'll need to execute the body.  
   For example, if you're traversing a list of elements, you know that the maximum
   number of loop iterations you can possibly need is "all the elements in the list".
   Or if you need to print the 12 times table, we know right away how many times
   the loop will need to run. 

   So any problem like "iterate this weather model for 1000 cycles", or "search this
   list of words", "find all prime numbers up to 10000" suggest that a ``for`` loop is best.

   By contrast, if you are required to repeat some computation until some condition is 
   met, and you cannot calculate in advance when (of if) this will happen, 
   as we did in this 3n + 1 problem, you'll need a ``while`` loop. 

   We call the first case **definite iteration** --- we know ahead of time some definite bounds for 
   what is needed.  The latter case is called **indefinite iteration** --- we're not sure
   how many iterations we'll need --- we cannot even establish an upper bound!    


.. index:: program tracing, hand trace, tracing a program

Tracing a program
-----------------

To write effective computer programs, and to build a good conceptual
model of program execution, a programmer needs to develop the ability
to **trace** the execution of a computer program. Tracing involves becoming the
computer and following the flow of execution through a sample program run,
recording the state of all variables and any output the program generates after
each instruction is executed.

To understand this process, let's trace the call to ``seq3np1(3)`` from the
previous section. At the start of the trace, we have a variable, ``n``
(the parameter), with an initial value of 3. Since 3 is not equal to 1, the
``while`` loop body is executed. 3 is printed and ``3 % 2 == 0`` is evaluated.
Since it evaluates to ``False``, the ``else`` branch is executed and
``3 * 3 + 1`` is evaluated and assigned to ``n``.

To keep track of all this as you hand trace a program, make a column heading on
a piece of paper for each variable created as the program runs and another one
for output. Our trace so far would look something like this:

    .. sourcecode:: pycon
        
        n               output printed so far
        --              ---------------------
        3               3, 
        10

Since ``10 != 1`` evaluates to ``True``, the loop body is again executed,
and 10 is printed. ``10 % 2 == 0`` is true, so the ``if`` branch is
executed and ``n`` becomes 5. By the end of the trace we have:

    .. sourcecode:: pycon

          n               output printed so far
          --              ---------------------
          3               3,
          10              3, 10,
          5               3, 10, 5,
          16              3, 10, 5, 16,
          8               3, 10, 5, 16, 8,
          4               3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4,
          2               3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2,
          1               3, 10, 5, 16, 8, 4, 2, 1.

Tracing can be a bit tedious and error prone (that's why we get computers to do
this stuff in the first place!), but it is an essential skill for a programmer
to have. 

..
   From this trace we can learn a lot about the way our code works. We
   can observe that as soon as ``n`` becomes a power of 2, for example, the program
   will require log\ :sub:`2`\ (n) executions of the loop body to complete. We can
   also see that the final 1 will not be printed as output within the body of the loop,
   which is why we put the special ``print`` function at the end. 

Tracing a program is, of course, related to single-stepping through your code
and being able to inspect the variables. Using the computer to **single-step** for you is
less error prone and more convenient. 
Also, as your programs get more complex, they might execute many millions of 
steps before they get to the code that you're really interested in, so manual tracing 
becomes impossible.  Being able to set a **breakpoint** where you need
one is far more powerful. 

..
   So we strongly encourage you to invest time in
   learning using to use your programming environment (PyScripter, in these notes) to full
   effect. 

..
   There are also some great visualization tools becoming available to help you 
   trace and understand small fragments of Python code.  The one we recommend is at 
   http://netserv.ict.ru.ac.za/python3_viz 

We've cautioned
against chatterbox functions, but used them here.  As we learn a bit more Python, we'll
be able to show you how to generate a list of values to hold the sequence, rather than having
the function print them. Doing this would remove the need to have all these pesky ``print`` functions
in the middle of our logic, and will make the function more useful.


.. _counting:

Counting digits
---------------

The following function counts the number of decimal digits in a positive
integer:

.. activecode:: countingdigits

   def num_digits(n):
       count = 0
       while n != 0:
           count = count + 1
           n = n // 10
       return count

   print(num_digits(731))
    
Trace the execution of this
function call to convince yourself that it works.

This function demonstrates an important pattern of computation called a **counter**.
The variable ``count`` is initialized to 0 and then incremented each time the
loop body is executed. When the loop exits, ``count`` contains the result ---
the total number of times the loop body was executed, which is the same as the
number of digits.

A common mistake is to forget to initialize your counter before you start your loop. You'll get a runtime error if you do that, like in the example below:

.. activecode:: countingwitherror

   def num_digits(n):
       while n != 0:
           count = count + 1
           n = n // 10
       return count

   print(num_digits(731))


If we wanted to only count digits that are either 0 or 5, adding a conditional
before incrementing the counter will do the trick:

.. activecode:: countingzerosandfives
        
   def num_zero_and_five_digits(n):
       count = 0
       while n > 0:
           digit = n % 10
           if digit == 0 or digit == 5:
               count = count + 1
           n = n // 10
       return count

   print(num_zero_and_five_digits(1055030250))

Confirm that ``num_zero_and_five_digits(1055030250)`` returns ``7``.

Notice, however, that ``num_digits(0)`` appears to fail.  Explain why.  Do you think this is a bug in
the code, or a bug in the specifications, or our expectations, or the tests?  

    
.. index:: abbreviated assignment    
    
Abbreviated assignment
----------------------

Incrementing a variable is so common that Python provides an abbreviated syntax
for it:

.. activecode:: selfincrement 

   count = 0
   print(count)
   count += 1
   print(count)
   count += 1
   print(count)

``count += 1`` is an abreviation for ``count = count + 1`` . We pronounce the operator
as *"plus-equals"*.  The increment value does not have to be 1:

.. activecode:: selfadd

   n = 2
   n += 5
   print(n)

There are similar abbreviations for ``-=``, ``*=``, ``/=``, ``//=`` and ``%=``:

.. activecode:: selfarith

   n = 2
   n *= 5
   print(n)  # 2 * 5 -> 10
   n -= 4
   print(n)  # 10 - 4 -> 6
   n //= 2
   print(n)  # 6 // 2 -> 3
   n %= 2
   print(n)  # 3 % 2 -> 1


.. index:: table, logarithm, Intel, Pentium, escape sequence, tab, newline 
         

Tables
------

One of the things loops are good for is generating tables.  Before
computers were readily available, people had to calculate logarithms, sines and
cosines, and other mathematical functions by hand. To make that easier,
mathematics books contained long tables listing the values of these functions.
Creating the tables was slow and boring, and they tended to be full of errors.

When computers appeared on the scene, one of the initial reactions was, *"This is
great! We can use the computers to generate the tables, so there will be no
errors."* That turned out to be true (mostly) but shortsighted. Soon thereafter,
computers and calculators were so pervasive that the tables became obsolete.

Well, almost. For some operations, computers use tables of values to get an
approximate answer and then perform computations to improve the approximation.
In some cases, there have been errors in the underlying tables, most famously
in the table the Intel Pentium processor chip used to perform floating-point division.

Although a log table is not as useful as it once was, it still makes a good
example of iteration. The following program outputs a sequence of values in the
left column and 2 raised to the power of that value in the right column:

.. activecode:: powersof2table 
       
   for x in range(13):   # Generate numbers 0 to 12
       print(str(x)+"\t"+str(2**x))

The string ``"\t"`` represents a **tab character**. The backslash character in
``"\t"`` indicates the beginning of an **escape sequence**.  Escape sequences
are used to represent invisible characters like tabs and newlines. The sequence
``\n`` represents a **newline**.

An escape sequence can appear anywhere in a string; in this example, the tab
escape sequence is the only thing in the string. How do you think you represent
a backslash in a string?

As characters and strings are displayed on the screen, an invisible marker
called the **cursor** keeps track of where the next character will go. After a
``print`` function, the cursor normally goes to the beginning of the next
line.

The tab character shifts the cursor to the right until it reaches one of the
tab stops. Tabs are useful for making columns of text line up, as in the output
of the previous program. Because of the tab characters between the columns, the position of the second
column does not depend on the number of digits in the first column.


.. index:: two-dimensional table

Two-dimensional tables
----------------------

A two-dimensional table is a table where you read the value at the intersection
of a row and a column. A multiplication table is a good example. Let's say you
want to print a multiplication table for the values from 1 to 6.

A good way to start is to write a loop that prints the multiples of 2, all on
one line:

.. activecode:: multtablestep1
        
   for i in range(1, 7):
       print(2 * i, end="   ")
   print()

Here we've used the ``range`` function, but made it start its sequence at 1. 
As the loop executes, the value of ``i`` changes from 1 to
6. When all the elements of the range have been assigned to ``i``, the loop terminates. 
Each time through the loop, it
displays the value of ``2 * i``, followed by three spaces.

Again, the extra ``end="   "`` argument in the ``print`` function suppresses the newline, and
uses three spaces instead.  After the
loop completes, the call to ``print`` at line 3 finishes the current line, and starts a new line.

So far, so good. The next step is to **encapsulate** and **generalize**.


.. index:: encapsulation, generalization, program development

Encapsulation and generalization
--------------------------------

Encapsulation is the process of wrapping a piece of code in a function,
allowing you to take advantage of all the things functions are good for. 

Generalization means taking something specific, such as printing the multiples
of 2, and making it more general, such as printing the multiples of any
integer.

This function encapsulates the previous loop and generalizes it to print
multiples of ``n``:

.. activecode:: multtablestep2
        
   def print_multiples(n):
       for i in range(1, 7):
           print(n * i, end="   ")
       print()

   print_multiples(2)
   print_multiples(3)
   print_multiples(4)

To encapsulate, all we had to do was add the first line, which declares the
name of the function and the parameter list. To generalize, all we had to do
was replace the value 2 with the parameter ``n``.

By now you can probably guess how to print a multiplication table --- by
calling ``print_multiples`` repeatedly with different arguments. In fact, we
can use another loop:

.. activecode:: multtablestep3
        
   def print_multiples(n):
       for i in range(1, 7):
           print(n * i, end="   ")
       print()

   for i in range(1, 7):
       print_multiples(i)

Notice how similar this loop is to the one inside ``print_multiples``.  All we
did was replace the ``print`` function with a function call. The output of this program is a multiplication table.


.. index:: development plan

More encapsulation
------------------

To demonstrate encapsulation again, let's take the code from the last section
and wrap it up in a function:

.. activecode:: multtablefinal
        
   def print_multiples(n):
       for i in range(1, 7):
           print(n * i, end="   ")
       print()

   def print_mult_table():
       for i in range(1, 7):
           print_multiples(i)

   print_mult_table()

This process is a common **development plan**. We develop code by writing lines
of code outside any function, or typing them in to the interpreter. When we get
the code working, we extract it and wrap it up in a function.

This development plan is particularly useful if you don't know how to divide
the program into functions when you start writing. This approach lets you
design as you go along.


.. index::
    single: local variable
    single: variable; local

Local variables
---------------

You might be wondering how we can use the same variable, ``i``, in both
``print_multiples`` and ``print_mult_table``. Doesn't it cause problems when
one of the functions changes the value of the variable?

The answer is no, because the ``i`` in ``print_multiples`` and the ``i`` in
``print_mult_table`` are *not* the same variable.

Variables created inside a function definition are local; you can't access a
local variable from outside its home function. That means you are free to have
multiple variables with the same name as long as they are not in the same
function.

Python examines all the statements in a function --- if any of them assign a value
to a variable, that is the clue that Python uses to make the variable a local variable.

The stack diagram for this program shows that the two variables named ``i`` are
not the same variable. They can refer to different values, and changing one
does not affect the other.

    .. image:: illustrations/stack2.png
       :alt: Stack 2 diagram 

The value of ``i`` in ``print_mult_table`` goes from 1 to 6. In the diagram it
happens to be 3. The next time through the loop it will be 4. Each time through
the loop, ``print_mult_table`` calls ``print_multiples`` with the current value
of ``i`` as an argument. That value gets assigned to the parameter ``n``.

Inside ``print_multiples``, the value of ``i`` goes from 1 to 6. In the
diagram, it happens to be 2. Changing this variable has no effect on the value
of ``i`` in ``print_mult_table``.

It is common and perfectly legal to have different local variables with the
same name. In particular, names like ``i`` and ``j`` are used frequently as
loop variables. If you avoid using them in one function just because you used
them somewhere else, you will probably make the program harder to read.

.. index:: break statement,  statement: break

The ``break`` statement 
-----------------------

The **break** statement is used to immediately leave the body of its loop.  The next
statement to be executed is the first one after the body: 

.. activecode:: breakexample
        
   for i in [12, 16, 17, 24, 29]: 
       if i % 2 == 1:  # If the number is odd
           break        #  ... immediately exit the loop
       print(i)
   print("done")
    
.. admonition::  The pre-test loop --- standard loop behavior

    ``for`` and ``while`` loops do their tests at the start, before executing
    any part of the body.   They're called **pre-test** loops, because the test
    happens before (pre) the body.    
    ``break`` and ``return`` are our tools for adapting this standard behavior.

    .. image:: illustrations/pre_test_loop.png  
    
Other flavors of loops
-----------------------  
  
Sometimes we'd like to have the **middle-test** loop with the exit test in the middle 
of the body, rather than at the beginning or at the end.  Or a **post-test** loop that
puts its exit test as the last thing in the body. Other languages have different
syntax and keywords for these different flavours, but Python just uses 
a combination of ``while`` and ``if condition: break`` to get the job done.    

A typical example is a problem where the user has to input numbers to be summed.  
To indicate that there are no more inputs, the user enters a special value, often
the value -1, or the empty string.  This needs a middle-exit loop pattern: 
input the next number, then test whether to exit, or else process the number: 

    .. admonition::  The middle-test loop flowchart

        .. image:: illustrations/mid_test_loop.png 
        
.. activecode:: sumbreakexample
        
   total = 0
   while True:
       response = input("Enter the next number. (Leave blank to end)")
       if response == "":
           break 
       total += int(response)
   print("The total of the numbers you entered is "+str(total))
        
Convince yourself that this fits the middle-exit loop flowchart: line 3
does some useful work, lines 4 and 5 can exit the loop, and if they don't
line 6 does more useful work before the next iteration starts.

The ``while bool-expr:`` uses the Boolean expression to determine whether to iterate again.
``True`` is a trivial Boolean expression, so ``while True:``  means *always do 
the loop body again*.  This is a language *idiom* --- a convention that
most programmers will recognize immediately. Since the expression on line 2
will never terminate the loop, (it is a dummy test) the programmer must arrange to 
break (or return) out of the loop body elsewhere, in some other way (i.e. in lines 4 and 5 in 
this sample). 

..
   A clever compiler or interpreter will understand that line 2 is a 
   fake test that must always succeed, so it won't even generate a test, and our flowchart 
   never even put the diamond-shape dummy test box at the top of the loop!  

Similarly, by just moving the ``if condition: break`` to the end of the loop body we
create a pattern for a post-test loop.  Post-test loops are used when you want to
be sure that the loop body always executes at least once (because the first test
only happens at the end of the execution of the first loop body). 
This is useful, for example, if we want to play an interactive game against 
the user --- we always want to play at least one game:

.. activecode:: guessinggamepseudo
   :nolinenums:
   :norun:

   while True:
       play_the_game_once()
       response = input("Play again? (yes or no)")
       if response != "yes":
           break 
   print("Goodbye!")
        
  
.. admonition::  Hint: Think about where you want the exit test to happen

    Once you've recognized that you need a loop to repeat something, think
    about its terminating condition --- when will I want to stop iterating?
    Then figure out whether you need to do the test before starting
    the first (and every other) iteration, or at the end of 
    the first (and every other) iteration, or perhaps in 
    the middle of each iteration.  Interactive programs that require input
    from the user or read from files often need to exit their loops in the 
    middle or at the end of an iteration, when it becomes clear that there is 
    no more data to process, or the user doesn't want to play our game anymore. 
  

.. index:: continue statement,  statement; continue

The ``continue`` statement
--------------------------

This is a control flow statement that causes the program to immediately skip the
processing of the rest of the body of the loop, *for the current iteration*.  But
the loop still carries on running for its remaining iterations: 

.. activecode:: continueexample

   for i in [12, 16, 17, 24, 29, 30]: 
       if i % 2 == 1:      # If the number is odd
           continue         # Don't process it
       print(i)
   print("done")

    

.. index:: function

Functions
---------

A few times now, we have mentioned all the things functions are good for. By
now, you might be wondering what exactly those things are.  Here are some of
them:

#. Capturing your mental chunking. Breaking your complex tasks into sub-tasks, and
   giving the sub-tasks a meaningful name is a powerful mental technique.  Look back
   at the example that illustrated the post-test loop: we assumed that we had a function
   called ``play_the_game_once``.  This chunking allowed us to put aside the details
   of the particular game --- is it a card game, or noughts and crosses, or a role playing
   game --- and simply focus on one isolated part of our program logic --- letting the player
   choose whether they want to play again.   
#. Dividing a long program into functions allows you to separate parts of the
   program, debug them in isolation, and then compose them into a whole.
#. Functions facilitate the use of iteration.
#. Well-designed functions are often useful for many programs. Once you write
   and debug one, you can reuse it.


Glossary

.. glossary::


    algorithm
        A step-by-step process for solving a category of problems.

    body
        The statements inside a loop.
        
    breakpoint
        A place in your program code where program execution will pause (or break),
        allowing you to inspect the state of the program's variables, or single-step
        through individual statements, executing them one at a time. 
        
    bump
        Programmer slang. Synonym for increment.

    continue statement
        A statement that causes the remainder of the current iteration of a loop to be skipped. 
        The flow of execution goes back to the top of the loop, evaluates the condition,
        and if this is true the next iteration of the loop will begin. 

    counter
        A variable used to count something, usually initialized to zero and
        incremented in the body of a loop.

    cursor
        An invisible marker that keeps track of where the next character will
        be printed.

    decrement
        Decrease by 1.

    definite iteration
        A loop where we have an upper bound on the number of times the 
        body will be executed.  Definite iteration is usually best coded
        as a ``for`` loop.    
        
    development plan
        A process for developing a program. In this chapter, we demonstrated a
        style of development based on developing code to do simple, specific
        things and then encapsulating and generalizing.

    encapsulate
        To divide a large complex program into components (like functions) and
        isolate the components from each other (by using local variables, for
        example).

    escape sequence
        An escape character, \\, followed by one or more printable characters
        used to designate a nonprintable character.

    generalize
        To replace something unnecessarily specific (like a constant value)
        with something appropriately general (like a variable or parameter).
        Generalization makes code more versatile, more likely to be reused, and
        sometimes even easier to write.

    increment
        Both as a noun and as a verb, increment means to increase by 1.

    infinite loop
        A loop in which the terminating condition is never satisfied.

    indefinite iteration
        A loop where we just need to keep going until some condition is met.
        A ``while`` statement is used for this case.      
        
    initialization (of a variable)
        To initialize a variable is to give it an initial value.  
        Since in Python variables don't exist
        until they are assigned values, they are initialized when they are
        created.  In other programming languages this is not the case, and
        variables can be created without being initialized, in which case they
        have either default or *garbage* values.

    iteration
        Repeated execution of a set of programming statements.

    loop
        The construct that allows allows us to repeatedly execute a
        statement or a group of statements until a terminating
        condition is satisfied.

    loop variable
        A variable used as part of the terminating condition of a loop.
     
    meta-notation
        Extra symbols or notation that helps describe other notation. Here we introduced
        square brackets, ellipses, italics, and bold as meta-notation to help 
        describe optional, repeatable, substitutable and fixed parts of the Python syntax.
     
    middle-test loop
        A loop that executes some of the body, then tests for the exit condition, 
        and then may execute some more of the body.  We don't have a special 
        Python construct for this case, but can 
        use ``while`` and ``break`` together.
    
    nested loop
        A loop inside the body of another loop.
    
    newline
        A special character that causes the cursor to move to the beginning of
        the next line.

    post-test loop
        A loop that executes the body, then tests for the exit condition.  We don't have a special
        Python construct for this, but can use ``while`` and ``break`` together.
        
    pre-test loop
        A loop that tests before deciding whether the execute its body.  ``for`` and ``while``
        are both pre-test loops.    
    
    single-step
        A mode of interpreter execution where you are able to execute your 
        program one step at a time, and inspect the consequences of that step. 
        Useful for debugging and building your internal mental model of what is
        going on.
     
    tab
        A special character that causes the cursor to move to the next tab stop
        on the current line.
        
    trichotomy
        Given any real numbers *a* and *b*, exactly one of the following
        relations holds: *a < b*, *a > b*, or *a == b*. Thus when you can
        establish that two of the relations are false, you can assume the
        remaining one is true.

    trace
        To follow the flow of execution of a program by hand, recording the
        change of state of the variables and any output produced.
