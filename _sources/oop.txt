More Classes and Objects
========================

MyTime
------

As another example of a user-defined type, we'll define a class called ``MyTime``
that records the time of day. We'll provide an ``__init__`` method to ensure
that every instance is created with appropriate attributes and initialization.  
The class definition looks like this:

.. activecode:: mytimedef
        
   class MyTime:
        
       def __init__(self, hrs=0, mins=0, secs=0):
           """ Create a MyTime object initialized to hrs, mins, secs """
           self.hours = hrs
           self.minutes = mins
           self.seconds = secs     
 
   # create a new MyTime object
   tim1 = MyTime(11, 59, 30)


The state diagram for the object looks like this:

    .. image:: illustrations/time.png 

We should also add a ``__str__``
method so that MyTime objects can print themselves decently.

.. activecode:: mytimestr
        
   class MyTime:
        
       def __init__(self, hrs=0, mins=0, secs=0):
           """ Create a MyTime object initialized to hrs, mins, secs """
           self.hours = hrs
           self.minutes = mins
           self.seconds = secs    

       def __str__(self):
           timeString = ""
           if self.hours < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.hours) + ":"
           if self.minutes < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.minutes) + ":"
           if self.seconds < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.seconds) 
           return timeString
 
   # create a new MyTime object
   tim1 = MyTime(11, 59, 30)
   print(tim1)

.. index:: function; pure

Pure functions
--------------

In the next few sections, we'll write two versions of a function called
``add_time``, which calculates the sum of two ``MyTime`` objects. They will demonstrate
two kinds of functions: pure functions and modifiers.

The following is a rough version of ``add_time``:

.. activecode:: addtimebad
        
   class MyTime:
        
       def __init__(self, hrs=0, mins=0, secs=0):
           """ Create a MyTime object initialized to hrs, mins, secs """
           self.hours = hrs
           self.minutes = mins
           self.seconds = secs    

       def __str__(self):
           timeString = ""
           if self.hours < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.hours) + ":"
           if self.minutes < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.minutes) + ":"
           if self.seconds < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.seconds) 
           return timeString

   def add_time(t1, t2):
       h = t1.hours + t2.hours
       m = t1.minutes + t2.minutes
       s = t1.seconds + t2.seconds
       sumTime = MyTime(h, m, s)
       return sumTime

The function creates a new ``MyTime`` object and
returns a reference to the new object. This is called a **pure function**
because it does not modify any of the objects passed to it as parameters and it
has no side effects, such as updating global variables, 
displaying a value, or getting user input.

Here is an example of how to use this function. We'll create two ``MyTime``
objects: ``currentTime``, which contains the current time; and ``breadTime``,
which contains the amount of time it takes for a breadmaker to make bread. Then
we'll use ``add_time`` to figure out when the bread will be done.  

.. activecode:: addtimebadex
        
   class MyTime:
        
       def __init__(self, hrs=0, mins=0, secs=0):
           """ Create a MyTime object initialized to hrs, mins, secs """
           self.hours = hrs
           self.minutes = mins
           self.seconds = secs    

       def __str__(self):
           timeString = ""
           if self.hours < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.hours) + ":"
           if self.minutes < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.minutes) + ":"
           if self.seconds < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.seconds) 
           return timeString

   def add_time(t1, t2):
       h = t1.hours + t2.hours
       m = t1.minutes + t2.minutes
       s = t1.seconds + t2.seconds
       sumTime = MyTime(h, m, s)
       return sumTime
        
   currentTime = MyTime(9, 14, 30)
   breadTime = MyTime(3, 35, 0)
   doneTime = add_time(currentTime, breadTime)
   print(doneTime)

The output of this program is ``12:49:30``, which is correct. On the other
hand, there are cases where the result is not correct. Can you think of one?

.. activecode:: addtimebreaks
        
   class MyTime:
        
       def __init__(self, hrs=0, mins=0, secs=0):
           """ Create a MyTime object initialized to hrs, mins, secs """
           self.hours = hrs
           self.minutes = mins
           self.seconds = secs    

       def __str__(self):
           timeString = ""
           if self.hours < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.hours) + ":"
           if self.minutes < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.minutes) + ":"
           if self.seconds < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.seconds) 
           return timeString

   def add_time(t1, t2):
       h = t1.hours + t2.hours
       m = t1.minutes + t2.minutes
       s = t1.seconds + t2.seconds
       sumTime = MyTime(h, m, s)
       return sumTime
        
   currentTime = MyTime(6, 32, 40)
   breadTime = MyTime(3, 35, 50)
   doneTime = add_time(currentTime, breadTime)
   print(doneTime)

The problem is that this function does not deal with cases where the number of
seconds or minutes adds up to more than sixty. When that happens, we have to
carry the extra seconds into the minutes column or the extra minutes into the
hours column.

Here's a better version of the function:

.. activecode:: addtimebetter
        
   class MyTime:
        
       def __init__(self, hrs=0, mins=0, secs=0):
           """ Create a MyTime object initialized to hrs, mins, secs """
           self.hours = hrs
           self.minutes = mins
           self.seconds = secs    

       def __str__(self):
           timeString = ""
           if self.hours < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.hours) + ":"
           if self.minutes < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.minutes) + ":"
           if self.seconds < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.seconds) 
           return timeString

   def add_time(t1, t2):
       h = t1.hours + t2.hours
       m = t1.minutes + t2.minutes
       s = t1.seconds + t2.seconds
       if s >= 60:
           s -= 60
           m += 1
       if m >= 60:
           m -= 60
           h += 1
       sumTime = MyTime(h, m, s)
       return sumTime
        
   currentTime = MyTime(6, 32, 40)
   breadTime = MyTime(3, 35, 50)
   doneTime = add_time(currentTime, breadTime)
   print(doneTime)

This function is starting to get bigger, and still doesn't work
for all possible cases.  Later we will
suggest an alternative approach that yields better code.

.. index:: modifier

Modifiers
---------

There are times when it is useful for a function to modify one or more of the
objects it gets as parameters. Usually, the caller keeps a reference to the
objects it passes, so any changes the function makes are visible to the caller.
Functions that work this way are called **modifiers**.

``increment``, which adds a given number of seconds to a ``MyTime`` object, would
be written most naturally as a modifier. A rough draft of the function looks like this:

.. activecode:: incrfirst
   :norun:
        
   def increment(t, secs):
       t.seconds += secs
       if t.seconds >= 60:
           t.seconds -= 60
           t.minutes += 1
       if t.minutes >= 60:
           t.minutes -= 60
           t.hours += 1

The first line performs the basic operation; the remainder deals with the
special cases we saw before.

Is this function correct? What happens if the parameter ``seconds`` is much
greater than sixty? In that case, it is not enough to carry once; we have to
keep doing it until ``seconds`` is less than sixty. One solution is to replace
the ``if`` statements with ``while`` statements:

.. activecode:: incrsecond
   :norun:
        
   def increment(t, secs):
       t.seconds += secs
       while t.seconds >= 60:
           t.seconds -= 60
           t.minutes += 1
       while t.minutes >= 60:
           t.minutes -= 60
           t.hours += 1

This function is now correct when seconds is not negative, and when
hours does not exceed 23, but it is not a particularly good solution.

Converting ``increment`` to a method
------------------------------------

Once again, OOP programmers would prefer to put functions that work with
``MyTime`` objects into the ``MyTime`` class, so let's convert ``increment`` 
to a method.

.. activecode:: mytimeincr
        
   class MyTime:
        
       def __init__(self, hrs=0, mins=0, secs=0):
           """ Create a MyTime object initialized to hrs, mins, secs """
           self.hours = hrs
           self.minutes = mins
           self.seconds = secs    

       def __str__(self):
           timeString = ""
           if self.hours < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.hours) + ":"
           if self.minutes < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.minutes) + ":"
           if self.seconds < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.seconds) 
           return timeString
           
       def increment(self, seconds):
           self.seconds += seconds 
           while self.seconds >= 60:
               self.seconds -= 60
               self.minutes += 1
           while self.minutes >= 60:
               self.minutes -= 60
               self.hours += 1

   currentTime = MyTime(6,32,40)
   currentTime.increment(70)
   print(currentTime)  # should print 06:33:50

The transformation is purely mechanical --- we move the definition into
the class definition and (optionally) change the name of the first parameter to
``self``, to fit with Python style conventions.

Now we can invoke ``increment`` using the syntax for invoking a method, as on line 32.
Again, the object on which the method is invoked gets assigned to the first
parameter, ``self``. The second parameter, ``seconds`` gets the value ``70``.

An "Aha!" insight
----------------- 

Often a high-level insight into the problem can make the programming much easier. 

In this case, the insight is that a ``MyTime`` object is really a 
three-digit number in base 60! The ``second``
component is the ones column, the ``minute`` component is the sixties column,
and the ``hour`` component is the thirty-six hundreds column.

When we wrote ``add_time`` and ``increment``, we were effectively doing
addition in base 60, which is why we had to carry from one column to the next.

This observation suggests another approach to the whole problem --- we can
convert a ``MyTime`` object into a single number and take advantage of the fact
that the computer knows how to do arithmetic with numbers.  The following
method is added to the ``MyTime`` class to convert any instance into 
a corresponding number of seconds:

.. activecode:: mytimetosec
        
   class MyTime:
        
       def __init__(self, hrs=0, mins=0, secs=0):
           """ Create a MyTime object initialized to hrs, mins, secs """
           self.hours = hrs
           self.minutes = mins
           self.seconds = secs    

       def __str__(self):
           timeString = ""
           if self.hours < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.hours) + ":"
           if self.minutes < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.minutes) + ":"
           if self.seconds < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.seconds) 
           return timeString
            
       def to_seconds(self):
           """ Return the number of seconds represented 
               by this instance 
           """
           return self.hours * 3600 + self.minutes * 60 + self.seconds
 

Now, all we need is a way to convert from an integer back to a ``MyTime`` object.
Supposing we have ``tsecs`` seconds, some integer division and mod operators
can do this for us:

.. activecode:: timeconversion
   :norun:
   :nolinenums:

   hrs = tsecs // 3600
   leftoversecs = tsecs % 3600
   mins = leftoversecs // 60
   secs = leftoversecs % 60  

You might have to think a bit to convince yourself that this technique to
convert from one base to another is correct. 

In OOP we're really trying to wrap together the data and the operations
that apply to it.  So we'd like to have this logic inside the ``MyTime``
class.  A good solution is to rewrite the class initializer so that it can 
cope with initial values of seconds or minutes that are outside the 
**normalized** values.  (A normalized time would be something
like 3 hours 12 minutes and 20 seconds.  The same time, but unnormalized 
could be 2 hours 70 minutes and 140 seconds.)  

Let's rewrite a more powerful initializer for ``MyTime``:

.. activecode:: mytimebetterinit
        
   class MyTime:
        
       def __init__(self, hrs=0, mins=0, secs=0):
           """ Create a new MyTime object initialized to hrs, mins, secs.
               The values of mins and secs may be outside the range 0-59,
               but the resulting MyTime object will be normalized.
           """
           # Calculate total seconds to represent
           totalsecs = hrs*3600 + mins*60 + secs   
           self.hours = totalsecs // 3600        # Split in h, m, s
           leftoversecs = totalsecs % 3600
           self.minutes = leftoversecs // 60
           self.seconds = leftoversecs % 60   

       def __str__(self):
           timeString = ""
           if self.hours < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.hours) + ":"
           if self.minutes < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.minutes) + ":"
           if self.seconds < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.seconds) 
           return timeString
            
       def to_seconds(self):
           """ Return the number of seconds represented 
               by this instance 
           """
           return self.hours * 3600 + self.minutes * 60 + self.seconds

Now we can rewrite ``add_time`` like this:

.. activecode:: addtimebest
        
   class MyTime:
        
       def __init__(self, hrs=0, mins=0, secs=0):
           """ Create a new MyTime object initialized to hrs, mins, secs.
               The values of mins and secs may be outside the range 0-59,
               but the resulting MyTime object will be normalized.
           """
           # Calculate total seconds to represent
           totalsecs = hrs*3600 + mins*60 + secs   
           self.hours = totalsecs // 3600        # Split in h, m, s
           leftoversecs = totalsecs % 3600
           self.minutes = leftoversecs // 60
           self.seconds = leftoversecs % 60   

       def __str__(self):
           timeString = ""
           if self.hours < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.hours) + ":"
           if self.minutes < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.minutes) + ":"
           if self.seconds < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.seconds) 
           return timeString
            
       def to_seconds(self):
           """ Return the number of seconds represented 
               by this instance 
           """
           return self.hours * 3600 + self.minutes * 60 + self.seconds
        
   def add_time(t1, t2):
       secs = t1.to_seconds() + t2.to_seconds()
       return MyTime(0, 0, secs)

   currentTime = MyTime(6, 32, 40)
   breadTime = MyTime(3, 35, 50)
   doneTime = add_time(currentTime, breadTime)
   print(doneTime)

This version is much shorter than the original, and it is much easier to
demonstrate or reason that it is correct.

.. index:: generalization

Generalization
--------------

In some ways, converting from base 60 to base 10 and back is harder than just
dealing with times. Base conversion is more abstract; our intuition for dealing
with times is better.

But if we have the insight to treat times as base 60 numbers and make the
investment of writing the conversions, we get a program that is shorter, 
easier to read and debug, and more reliable.

It is also easier to add features later. For example, imagine subtracting two
``MyTime`` objects to find the duration between them. The naive approach would be to
implement subtraction with borrowing. Using the conversion functions would be
easier and more likely to be correct.

Ironically, sometimes making a problem harder (or more general) makes the
programming easier, because there are fewer special cases and fewer opportunities 
for error.

.. admonition:: Specialization versus Generalization

    Computer Scientists are generally fond of specializing their types, while mathematicians
    often take the opposite approach, and generalize everything.
    
    What do we mean by this? 
    
    If we ask a mathematician to solve a problem involving weekdays, days of the century, 
    playing cards, time, or dominoes, their most likely response is
    to observe that all these objects can be represented by integers. Playing cards, for example,
    can be numbered from 0 to 51.  Days within the century can be numbered. Mathematicians will say 
    *"These things are enumerable --- the elements can be uniquely numbered (and we can
    reverse this numbering to get back to the original concept). So let's number 
    them, and confine our thinking to integers.  Luckily, we have powerful techniques and a 
    good understanding of integers, and so our abstractions --- the way we tackle and simplify 
    these problems --- is to try to reduce them to problems about integers."* 

    Computer Scientists tend to do the opposite.  We will argue that there are many integer
    operations that are simply not meaningful for dominoes, or for days of the century.  So
    we'll often define new specialized types, like ``MyTime``, because we can restrict,
    control, and specialize the operations that are possible.  Object-oriented programming
    is particularly popular because it gives us a good way to bundle methods and specialized data
    into a new type.   

    Both approaches are powerful problem-solving techniques. Often it may help to try to
    think about the problem from both points of view --- *"What would happen if I tried to reduce
    everything to very few primitive types?"*, versus 
    *"What would happen if this thing had its own specialized type?"*    


Operator overloading
--------------------

Some languages, including Python, make it possible to have different meanings for
the same operator when applied to different types.  For example, ``+`` in Python
means quite different things for integers and for strings.  This feature is called
**operator overloading**.

It is especially useful when programmers can also overload the operators for their
own user-defined types.  

For example, to override the addition operator ``+``, we can provide a method named
``__add__``:

.. activecode:: addtimeoverload
        
   class MyTime:
        
       def __init__(self, hrs=0, mins=0, secs=0):
           """ Create a new MyTime object initialized to hrs, mins, secs.
               The values of mins and secs may be outside the range 0-59,
               but the resulting MyTime object will be normalized.
           """
           # Calculate total seconds to represent
           totalsecs = hrs*3600 + mins*60 + secs   
           self.hours = totalsecs // 3600        # Split in h, m, s
           leftoversecs = totalsecs % 3600
           self.minutes = leftoversecs // 60
           self.seconds = leftoversecs % 60   

       def __str__(self):
           timeString = ""
           if self.hours < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.hours) + ":"
           if self.minutes < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.minutes) + ":"
           if self.seconds < 10:
               timeString += "0"
           timeString += str(self.seconds) 
           return timeString
            
       def to_seconds(self):
           """ Return the number of seconds represented 
               by this instance 
           """
           return self.hours * 3600 + self.minutes * 60 + self.seconds
        
       def __add__(self, other):
           secs = self.to_seconds() + other.to_seconds()
           return MyTime(0, 0, secs)

   currentTime = MyTime(6, 32, 40)
   breadTime = MyTime(3, 35, 50)
   doneTime = currentTime + breadTime
   print(doneTime)
           
As usual, the first parameter is the object on which the method is invoked. The
second parameter is conveniently named ``other`` to distinguish it from
``self``.  To add two ``MyTime`` objects, we create and return a new ``MyTime`` object 
that contains their sum.

Now, when we apply the ``+`` operator to ``MyTime`` objects, Python invokes
the ``__add__`` method that we have written. The expression ``currentTime + breadTime`` is equivalent to ``currentTime.__add__(breadTime)``, but obviously
more elegant.  

As an exercise, add a method ``__sub__(self, other)`` that
overloads the subtraction operator, and try it out.  


Glossary
--------

.. glossary::

        
    functional programming style
        A style of program design in which the majority of functions are pure.
        
    modifier
        A function or method that changes one or more of the objects it receives as
        parameters. Most modifier functions are void (do not return a value).
        
    normalized
        Data is said to be normalized if it fits into some reduced range or set of rules. 
        We usually normalize our angles to values in the range [0..360). We normalize
        minutes and seconds to be values in the range [0..60).  And we'd 
        be surprised if the local store advertised its cold drinks at "One dollar,
        two hundred and fifty cents".
        
    operator overloading
        Extending built-in operators ( ``+``, ``-``, ``*``, ``>``, ``<``, etc.)
        so that they do different things for different types of arguments. We've
        seen early in the book how ``+`` is overloaded for numbers and strings,
        and here we've shown how to further overload it for user-defined types.
 
    pure function
        A function that does not modify any of the objects it receives as
        parameters. Most pure functions are fruitful rather than void.
